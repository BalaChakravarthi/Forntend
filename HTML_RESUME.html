<h4>PROJECTS</h4>
<p><b>Automatic Player Face Detection and Recognition for Players in Cricket Games</b></p>
<li>- This study focuses on automatic face detection and recognition of cricket players using a combination of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and the AdaBoost algorithm</li>
<li>- The Viola-Jones OpenCV algorithm is employed to detect player faces, which are then processed through LDA for feature extraction and trained with AdaBoost for recognition</li>
<li>Three algorithms were evaluated: an existing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the proposed PAL AdaBoost, and an enhanced VGG19-CNN model. Results demonstrated that the proposed PAL AdaBoost achieved 91% accuracy, while the enhanced VGG19-CNN model outperformed all, achieving an impressive 95% accuracy. Performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score were also calculated, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</li>
